Abstract: In nature, different species of smaller animals produce ultra-fast movements to aid in their locomotion or protect themselves against predators. These ultra-fast impulsive motions are possible, as often times, there exist a small latch in the organism that could hold the potential energy of the system, and once released, generate an impulsive motion. These types of systems are classified as Latch Mediated Spring Actuated (LaMSA) systems, a multi-dimensional, multi-mode hybrid system that switches between a latched and an unlatched state. The LaMSA mechanism has been studied extensively in the field of biology and is observed in a wide range of animal species, such as the mantis shrimp, grasshoppers, and trap-jaw ants. In recent years, research has been done in mathematically modeling the LaMSA behavior with physical implementations of the mechanism. A significant focus is given to mimicking the physiological behavior of the species and following an end-to-end trajectory of impulsive motion. This paper introduces a foundational analysis of the theoretical dynamics of the contact latch-based LaMSA mechanism. The authors answer the question on what makes these small-scale systems impulsive, with a focus on the intrinsic properties of the system using bifurcations. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the saddle fixed points. The authors propose a mathematical explanation for mediating the latch when a saddle node exists, and the impulsive behavior after the bifurcation happens.

Abstract: For many systems, there is an objective to minimize control effort while also providing a fast convergence rate. In the past decade, quadratic programming (QP) and control Lyapunov functions (CLF) have been combined to create on-line feedback controllers which minimize control effort subject to convergence rate guarantees. However, these convergence rate guarantees can sometimes be too slow, or require strong conditions for the closed loop system. Similarly, an existing controller may provide a fast convergence rate, but require too much control effort. In this paper, we introduce a flexible exponentially stabilizing CLF condition, which admits various convergence rates. This relaxation allows a novel QP-based controller with a state-dependent tuning parameter to adaptively tune between the convergence rate and control effort. We show the QP-based controller can be applied to any exponentially stabilizing CLF, and the solution is piecewise continuous with exponential convergence guarantees. A comparative study to other control types such as min-norm based control and geometric control for attitude tracking on SO(3) is shown to validate the trade-off benefits of using the proposed flexible CLF control.
